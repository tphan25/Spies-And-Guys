SPIES AND GUYS - A Resistance Spinoff
================================================================================
================================================================================
BACKGROUND - Characters
================================================================================

The year is 2021; you are an elite legion of native Pluto space pirates with one
goal in mind: to  conquer the once great planet Earth and steal its resources to
fuel your home planet's intense lack of oxygen. Only a few raids stand between you
and stealing all of planet Earth's oxygen; however, a few obstacles have arisen in
your path.

Some of your fellow pirates have been bribed heavily by Earth's own population;
these spies have infiltrated the highest ranks of your space pirate hierarchy and
they mean to sabotage the missions and ensure that Earth lives on. Your mission
is to single out just who these spies are, and make sure they cannot sabotage the
mission of vacuuming what little resources Earth has left.

GAMEPLAY - Basics
================================================================================

Before the game begins:
You will be assigned a role: Guy, or Spy. Guys are the "protagonists" here; they
will not know who any of their fellow Guys are. Spies are the "antagonists", and
they will know who their fellow Spies are. The spies' mission is to work together
to sabotage the Guys and win a majority of the 5 rounds in the game.

In Game, Each Round:
There are 5 rounds in the game, and each round has a specific number X associated
with it. This number X represents the number of "Guys" who must go on the "mission"
for the round. 

Phase 1:
One player will be selected as "Big Guy" who will determine who
will go on the mission (generally start randomly then pass it in order per round).
The "Big Guy" will choose X players to go on the mission (can choose themselves).
Players may debate here for which players to encourage the "Big Guy" to select.

Once X players are selected, a vote is taken; if the majority of players APPROVES
the mission, then proceed into phase 2. If the majority of players DECLINES then
move on to the next player to be the "Big Guy" and select them.
In the event of a tie, the Big Guy's vote goes through (APPROVE/DECLINE) and phase
2 begins.
NOTE: If players DECLINE missions 4 times in a row, the 5th mission selected goes
through without any voting process.

Phase 2:
X players have been selected corresponding to the round and APPROVED (whether on
purpose or by default). These players have two choices to anonymously pick from:
Whether to PASS or to FAIL the mission. However, Guys can only choose to PASS,
so it is up to the SPIES to choose to FAIL the mission if needed. (NOTE: in some
cases, more than one FAIL is required.)
